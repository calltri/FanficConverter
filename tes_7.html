This was not a particularly unusual state for her. She wasn&rsquo;t ok when Madoka died. In hindsight she wasn&rsquo;t really ok for the entire duration of her time as a magical girl, except maybe right at the start when she was </span><span class="c1">even more useless</span><span>&nbsp;ignorant</span><span>. There were some times when she was close to ok, such as during a particularly good timeline when she and Madoka </span><span class="c1">had fallen for each other?</span><span>&nbsp;had a particularly good relationship</span><span>. But that just made things worse when things inevitably fell apart. She definitely wasn&rsquo;t ok when </span><span>Madoka </span><span class="c1">left her</span><span>&nbsp;disappeared. She wasn&rsquo;t ok when she woke up, alone, at age 10 in 1990 without </span><span class="c1">Madoka</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;her soul gem and with Kyubey nowhere to be seen. She supposed she might have been ok as a child occasionally, she didn&rsquo;t really remember much from back then that well. But she was in the hospital, faintly remembered bullies at some point, and her mom always seemed to be occupied with one business trip after another. So probably not.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Recently she had been a tad closer to ok than normal. The decision to leave Mitakihara had in hindsight been a very good one. Admittedly it wasn&rsquo;t one that Homura agreed with at the time, but her therapist had managed to convince her mother, and she wasn&rsquo;t quite willing to be declared a run away yet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was another weird thing, her mother actually cared about her now. Maybe she did before as well, her schooling and care facilities were on the expensive side after all. But after a few months of following empty routines she no longer had a purpose for, Ms. Akemi had come home to check up on her, and decided dropping everything to get Homura a therapist was absolutely necessary after only a day. There was something about Homura not seeming to care about anything and not recognizing her own mother in the explanation for that decision, but Homura honestly wasn&rsquo;t paying that much attention at the time. Her mother was going to disappear in a couple of days like she always did anyways, so it&rsquo;s not like it really mattered.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Except she didn&rsquo;t. While she was still constantly working, she apparently pulled some strings to switch to mostly local work, and drastically cut her business trips. Homura was very confused by this, but&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t as if she was upset that someone would occasionally make her </span><span class="c1">admittedly a tad mediocre</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;meals beyond pre-cooked convenience store items and ask her how her day went. The therapist was still more irritating than helpful, given she couldn&rsquo;t really share anything about without being thrown in an asylum, but she supposed she could deal. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Magic also existed in this world, Homura had discovered. It felt&hellip; weird, and considerably less constrained but harder to use than the magic of a magical girl. Fortunately, the feeling of her magic was so ingrained in her after decades of use that replicating much of it was easy. Her time powers proved out of her reach, but her general enhancement spells, healing, and shield summoning remained functional, if slightly less efficient or effective. Which was very good, the few moments when she thought she no longer had access to her shield were </span><span class="c1">not safe, danger, she wasn&rsquo;t safe anything could kill her</span><span>&nbsp;inconvenient, and having physical evidence </span><span class="c1">of Madoka</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;that she was not actually insane beyond a ribbon helped. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There was also apparently a school for magic in Japan that she was supposed to attend, Homura learned. Her first year there&hellip; did not go well. They kept calling all the girl&rsquo;s witches, for one, which&hellip; may have triggered some of Homura&rsquo;s instincts. Sayaka, Mami, Kyoko and several of the other girls she knew were there too, and Homura could admit she did not handle that particularly well. It was already hard enough to keep her feelings managed with </span><span class="c1">Madoka around</span><span>&nbsp;a purpose. Without that her feelings slipped from indifference to fear to hatred at them for </span><span class="c1">surviving when Madoka didn&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;not doing enough at the drop of a hat. Not to mention the dozen times in the first semester she nearly executed Oriko Mifune before remembering Oriko hadn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c1">killed Madoka</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;done anything deserving of that. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After one particularly bad day, Akemi even decided to indulge her therapist&rsquo;s questions about how she felt at school (her mother still insisted on her seeing one for some reason) and tell her the truth. Or a version of it, anyways, with all the magic bits filtered out. The resulting talk went at least an hour over, and if Homura had still been a magical girl she would&rsquo;ve witched out at least a couple times over the course of it. As is she went to bed still crying slightly and completely exhausted. On the other hand it might have felt slightly good to have done it&hellip; maybe&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The next day her mother told her that she&rsquo;d talked to her therapist, and apparently said therapist very strongly recommended they get Homura far, far away from Japan. She intended to follow that advice. After the talk just the day before, Homura couldn&rsquo;t find it in herself to complain. It was unfortunately a fact that just about everything in Mitakihara reminded her of </span><span class="c1">her failures</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;unpleasant events. As such the family of two found themselves moving to Britain, where Homura&rsquo;s mother had several business ties and which reportedly had a good school for learning magic.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Her year at Hogwarts went much better. There were many fewer memories of </span><span class="c1">Madoka</span><span>&nbsp;Her, and so Homura wasn&rsquo;t prompted to </span><span class="c1">agonize over</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;think about her failings. While she was still called a witch, the English word was sufficiently different from the Japanese version that she felt fine being called it. Her house was also nice. She wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure why they talked to her, but they seemed friendly and were remarkably persistent with trying to forge a connection. It only took a few months to figure out which topics she was willing to talk about with actual interest and which she merely pretended a slight interest in.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The whole Chamber of Secrets debacle was slightly concerning, but didn&rsquo;t register as that much of a threat. Certainly Homura was concerned, and spent several nights tried to find the attacker and keep her fellow students safe. But she never seemed to be in the right spot at the right time. And everything was made more difficult after her house figured out what she was doing and started doing their best to follow her everywhere, which drastically cut her ability to patrol. Even during the farce of a dueling club she was on the wrong side of the crowd when Draco&rsquo;s snake fell into the middle of it, and by the time she pushed through to protect her classmates the Potter girl had managed to stop it. &nbsp;And the scale of danger was so much lower than she was used to. No one even died in the entire year, whereas in any given 6 week time loop Homura experienced </span><span class="c1">the deaths of Madoka, most to all of her friends, all of the witches she fought, several witch victims, other magical girls she ran into, the mass casualties of Walpurgisnacht&hellip;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a few.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sirius Black&rsquo;s spell that apparently killed a dozen muggles and a wizard was likewise not particularly interesting. After all, any of the numerous rpgs she had in her shield could do that </span><span class="c1">and had a few times early on when she missed her target when one of the magical girls decided to try and kill her. Again</span><span class="c2">. The dementors were concerning for slightly different reasons. They felt somewhat like witches, which automatically flagged them as a concern. More troubling than their combat potential (which appeared minimal on an individual level) was their organization and the fact that they had apparently joined up with the ministry officials. Homura still could not fundamentally comprehend why anyone would think that was a good idea, but the result was unfortunate for her ability to exterminate them. Speaking of Dementors, she really needed to talk to Lupin about them at some point&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Regardless, the particular reason that Homura was not feeling ok today was that she was walking to what was apparently a lesson on boggarts, beings which took on the form of your greatest fear. Homura was not a fan of this concept, nor of the fact that the professor had decided showing off everyone&rsquo;s fears to the class was the best way to do it. Homura also had no real idea of what her greatest fear would be at the moment. She&rsquo;d already failed, after all, it&rsquo;s not like she could fail again, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In response to Hannah&rsquo;s increasingly concerned glances, Homura finally responded, &ldquo;I&hellip; should be fine. The experience will likely be unpleasant, but I&rsquo;ve survived worse.&rdquo; It would suck, but she had plenty of experience with Elsa Maria&rsquo;s familiars before. This probably wouldn&rsquo;t be much worse.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She had responded just in time, as the Hufflepuffs had reached the room. Lupin closed the door, explained the task, and proceeded to ask the students to line up. Homura took a place at the rear. Apparently the Gryffindor class ended early, maybe this one would too?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One by one the students went. Homura didn&rsquo;t really see anything particularly noteworthy. There were a few &lsquo;creepy&rsquo; looking bugs and animals, indeterminate monsters, and abstract ones whose cause wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent. Susan had a series of graves appear before her, possibly the most morbid, but was able to turn them into flowers after several moments of hesitation. Hannah, meanwhile, had a boggart of her friends throwing insults at her. One of those being Homura for some reason. But a quick glance back at her actual friends and Hannah had managed to riddikulus them all into being buried in cats. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In an instant it was Homura&rsquo;s turn. She stepped forward, the boggart paused to consider her, and then it turned&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Into a carbon copy of Madoka in her magical girl outfit. Homura, confused, continued looking her over. Upon closer inspection, Homura noticed It wasn&rsquo;t quite Madoka. Parts of it and it&rsquo;s clothing seemed wrong, almost two dimensional, and shifting out of sync with the rest of it&rsquo;s body. Almost like someone had fused random paper onto it. It&rsquo;s soul gem was some swirling mix of pink and darkness. When it shifted, the interaction of the real and witchy parts of her did some&hellip; unpleasant stretching. Homura absentmindedly noted the sounds of gulping in the background. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Homura-chan&hellip;&rdquo; It let out in a miserable sounding tone, tears filling its eyes. &ldquo;Why does it hurt so much&hellip; All that despair and pain and suffering&hellip; everything hurts, this is hell, why did you do this to me Homura-chan? Why didn&rsquo;t you just let me be after you murdered me the first time? Why did you keep torturing me again and again until I put myself into eternal torment? Was I just a target of your perverted interests? Did you do all that just to try and manipulate me into a relationship!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Homura flinched back slightly. The idea that Madoka was in eternal pain, to the point where being dead would have been preferable to her current state, was definitely a recurring fear of hers. Combining that with the rejection by her </span><span class="c1">crush</span><span>&nbsp;friend&hellip; If this had been the real Madoka&hellip;well if it was the real Madoka this would never happen. She was too kind to be this harsh </span><span class="c1">even if everything the boggart said was true</span><span class="c2">. But while the boggart was good at mimicking Madoka, it didn&rsquo;t feel like her. Not truly. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Homura successfully managed to hold herself mostly steady, the boggart continued in a slight drawl. &ldquo;Homura-Chan&hellip; killing my own witch messed me up really bad. You&rsquo;re not supposed to do that you know. As is&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s going to burst, and shatter me permanently in a way you won&rsquo;t be able to fix&hellip;&rdquo; It pointed towards the mock soul gem that it had, which had started pulsing, faster and faster. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Homura would have been more concerned with this if the gem wasn&rsquo;t an obvious fake that didn&rsquo;t have&hellip; magic&hellip; wait. That gem was indeed pulsing with magic. It was at this point that Homura remembered a line from her textbook. &ldquo;</span><span class="c7">A boggart can carry a pale rendition of the powers of the being it copies</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo; Given it had copied Madoka, whose power was literally inconceivable, and whose witch was similar in power&hellip; Homura started moving almost before her thought finished. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Her eyes flashed to her right. Lupin, it seemed, was still occupied staring at the abomination. Not an option. He was too out of it to respond to her commands instantly, and seconds might matter. The gem&rsquo;s pulsing increased in speed again. Homura certainly couldn&rsquo;t cast a riddikulus, while the boggart wasn&rsquo;t Madoka, the idea of making fun of anything Madoka shaped was&hellip; not really workable. Especially without any practice. The gem pulsed even faster. That left one option.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura summoned her shield and reached in to pull out a shotgun. The boggart needed to die, and die now. Whatever it was about to do, with Madoka&rsquo;s power behind it it could do anything from kill everyone in their classroom to destroy the world. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now equipped, she fired. One shot at the soul gem itself. &ldquo;BAM!&rdquo; Reload. One headshot to make sure the abomination was dead. &ldquo;BAM!&rdquo; Reload. Fire remaining shots into the body to ensure it was dea-</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;EXPELLIARMUS&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A secondary hostile to the right had just disarmed her. With the first one dead and unknowns behind her, Homura went for a flashbang. She grabbed one, pulled the pin, prepared to throw it up into the air-</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;HOMURA STOP!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Momentarily confused, Akemi paused to observe the situation. The boggart seemed very dead, still somewhat in its fake Madoka form but bubbling and slowly dissolving. Professor Lupin seemed to have been the one to cast the expelliarmus, and was now holding Homura&rsquo;s wand and shotgun. Hannah seemed to have been the one to call out to her based on the sound of her voice. Oh, and she was holding a flashbang that had maybe two seconds left on its timer at this point. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura quickly rammed the flashbang back into her shield. Having it go off would only make things go worse. Seeing that Homura was standing down, Lupin relaxed slightly.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What in Merlin&rsquo;s name was that, Akemi,&rdquo; he let out in a very cold tone of voice. &ldquo;You were supposed to use the ridiculous spell or, failing that, let me take care of it, not pull out a muggle firearm and start shooting it!&rdquo; As he said that he gestured with his left hand, the one holding said firearm. Homura froze.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, sir, before we get into this I really need that gun back,&rdquo; she said, attempting to get the situation back under control. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, Akemi you may not. In fact I am confiscating this weapon until further notice, and-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No really, I need to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Homura, is that gun still loaded?&rdquo; a third voice cut into their discussion, disturbingly calm. Both parties turned to see Justin Finch-Fletchley, pale and staring up the barrel of the gun that Lupin was inadvertently pointing at him. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At Homura&rsquo;s nod, Lupin somewhat sheepishly directed the barrel away for her classmates and placed it carefully by the wall. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, trying that again. Homura, what was that?&rdquo; Lupin once again asked. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura was ready to answer this time. &ldquo;Sir, I approached the boggart as instructed. It took the form of Madoka Kaname, a previous friend of mine.&rdquo; If anyone noticed how her voice hitched slightly on the word &lsquo;friend,&rsquo; they were kind enough not to say anything. &ldquo;The boggart attempted various attacks on me by appealing to my fears. Everything was proceeding as normal until it started channeling magic around the gem at the base of her neck.&rdquo; Homura pointed to clarify.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It seemed like it was going for some kind of attack,&rdquo; Homura continued, not incorrectly. &ldquo;Additionally, Madoka had more magical power than I have ever seen elsewhere. I concluded a, quote, &lsquo;pale rendition&rsquo; of her powers would be very likely to kill everyone in this room.&rdquo; Half the class flinched at that. Lupin, however, frowned. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Akemi, that&rsquo;s not how that works. Boggarts only produce a &lsquo;pale rendition&rsquo; of other&rsquo;s powers due to the inherent limitations of the boggart itself. A boggart of You-Know-Who and Sirius Black would be on the same level of power, barely worse than a first year, despite a very real difference in power between those two.&rdquo; Akemi frowned. That sounded like information that really should have been in the textbook. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t answer all of my questions though. Why didn&rsquo;t you attempt to cast riddikulus?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;With a threat of that magnitude I didn&rsquo;t want to rest my survival on an untested technique. Also&hellip; I&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t sure if I could pull it off.&rdquo; Homura admitted.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Lupin nodded in understanding. &ldquo;I could see how that could be an issue,&rdquo; he said while glancing back to were the boggart had been. &ldquo;An alternative could have been to use the spell to force the boggart into another form associated with a different emotion. Laughter tends to work best, but some other kind of positive emotion would work as well. An outfit from a particularly fond memory, for instance, could work.&rdquo; Akemi nodded. That also would have been nice to know beforehand. &ldquo;What was that thing you pulled out at the end?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A flashbang, sir. It&rsquo;s a non lethal muggle device designed to cause a large noise and flash to disorient opponents.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you were aware enough to stick to non lethal. I will need to confiscate that device as well, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura gave him an incredulous look. &ldquo;Professor&hellip; I already activated that. As soon as I take it out of my shield the countdown will resume. With how much time remains it would go off before I could even hand it to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah. It&hellip; hasn&rsquo;t already gone off then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, sir. The contents of my shield are under a temporal lock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, probably best to leave it in there then. I&rsquo;m afraid I will need to confiscate your shield in that case though.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; sorry?&rdquo; Homura asked, tilting her head questioningly.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;ll need you to hand over your shield,&rdquo; Lupin repeated.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s not possible, sir.&rdquo; Lupin shifted at that, replying in a more authoritarian tone.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Akemi, that wasn&rsquo;t a suggestion, as a teacher I am requiring tha-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sir, I didn&rsquo;t mean my willingness to hand over my shield was lacking.&rdquo; Homura spoke out over his voice. Obviously it was, but that was immaterial next to a bigger issue. &ldquo;I meant that my shield is tied directly to my-&rdquo; soul &ldquo;- magic. If I gave it to you it&rsquo;d just dissolve, and return to me when I next called for it.&rdquo; Demonstrating, Homura unsummoned and summoned her shield a few times. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lupin paused for a moment. &ldquo;That&hellip; right&hellip; where exactly did you learn to do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Japan.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At Homura&rsquo;s lack of any further explanation, Lupin sighed. &ldquo;Right, well I still need access to it to remove any other weapons you might have in there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura felt herself rapidly losing patience with this entire conversation. &ldquo;Sir. I am the only one able to access the contents of my shield. Even if I said I have no other weapons left in it, you would have no way of verifying my claims, making the entire exercise pointless. Furthermore I don&rsquo;t exactly understand why you care about &lsquo;inferior muggle firearms&rsquo; when every student carries a wand and is taught how to cause explosions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&hellip;&rdquo; Before continuing his line of questioning, Lupin looked around. The class of Hufflepuffs seemed to have somewhat recovered from their ordeal, though many of them still looked shell shocked and no one was in particularly good shape. The ones that were more intact were eyeing the conversation with considerable interest. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, I think that&rsquo;s enough activity for today. Why don&rsquo;t you all go to the hospital wing so Madam Pomfrey can take a look at you. Hannah, you can be in charge. Also, 5 points to Hufflepuff for helping Akemi remember where she was.&rdquo; Many of the Hufflepuffs looked disappointed that they were being kicked out, but they all left in short order. Lupin then proceeded to close the door and cast various spells to secure the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;A</span><span class="c2">lright, Akemi. You are right that I can&rsquo;t ensure you don&rsquo;t have any weapons on you if what you say is true. However, there are measures I can take if I really need to, such as Verisaterum.&rdquo; Homura frowned. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reasonably sure that usage of Verisaterum is heavily restricted, extremely expensive, and illegal to use on minors.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d made sure to look it up as soon as she discovered truth potions were a thing, just in case.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lupin raised an eyebrow in response. &ldquo;Generally yes, however it can be taken in certain circumstances if both the child and child&rsquo;s parents agree. In this case, we would have a prepared question asking if you had weapons in your shield, and would cover nothing else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And if I refused questioning?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You would be able to refuse</span><span>. At least assuming the Aurors didn&rsquo;t get involved&hellip; But not taking this option would mean that if I or Dumbledore deemed the shield&rsquo;s contents a threat to the school, our only alternative would be to expel you as well as your shield from Hogwarts.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Homura thought about how to respond for a moment as Lupin watched. Eventually, she slowly nodded. It wasn&rsquo;t ideal, but it was more reasonable than many magical girls were about dealing with potential threats.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very well. I understand your reasoning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lupin sighed in relief at her agreement. &ldquo;Good, good. Now&hellip; in the two instances you&rsquo;ve used them you&rsquo;ve done so because you believed your classmates were in danger. And in one of those cases they arguably were. As such&hellip; I&rsquo;ll let it lie for now, though I will be bringing this up with Dumbledore. That said, please do not use your weapons again in anything but a life or death scenario. Your wand should outperform firearms with enough practice anyways, comes with a host of nonlethal options, and is much less likely to get the ministry involved. And if you manage to shoot a student, even accidentally, I will need to escalate this.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura nodded again in understanding. It was true that her wand was a considerably more versatile weapon. Even if it lacked the sheer weight of fire guns could produce.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As is, I&rsquo;m still taking 30 points from Hufflepuff for a disproportionate response to a low level threat when a teacher was there that you could have asked for help from instead.&rdquo; Oh right, Homura supposed points were still a thing. She&rsquo;d never really paid attention to them before. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Moving on. Akemi, I don&rsquo;t suppose you can tell me how you keep killing unkillable nonbeings with firearms?&rdquo; Homura looked over towards the clearly dead boggart. Ah yes, she did recall that boggarts were technically not supposed to be killed. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&hellip; infuse a bit of my magic into the gun. It doesn&rsquo;t really do anything to change the physical properties of the gun, but it does make them markably more effective against wraith like creatures.&rdquo; Homura had figured out that when she stumbled upon a policeman in a labyrinth who had retained his mind enough to vainly fight some familiars. While his gun barely bruised the creatures, Akemi&rsquo;s similar weapons ripped through them like paper. Upon asking the Incubator about the situation, it mentioned that as witches were made of emotions and magic, a purely physical attack would have no effect on it unless empowered by magic or human emotion. Which apparently magical girls did automatically to anything they touched so as to be more effective at fighting Witches, and which was why Akemi could use regular firearms. Larger enchantments were also possible, but they were not particularly cost effective. Not that telling Lupin all of this was an option though, it would raise far too many questions. As such Homura continued with, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you exactly why it does though.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to look into that at some point,&rdquo; Lupin muttered. &ldquo;Being able to replicate that would be a game changer for the wizarding world. Right, if there&rsquo;s nothing else I think you can take your leave.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After removing the wards and unloading the shotgun (which was then left with Lupin), she was finally free. On her way out, Lupin drew her attention once more. &ldquo;Also, Akemi, 10 points to Hufflepuff for quick thought and decisive action in the face of your boggart. You didn&rsquo;t make the best decision, but you acted, and that is far more likely to keep you safe than deliberating until you have the perfect plan.&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After this Homura proceeded back to the classroom to grab her books, before heading to the just starting dinner. Hopefully it would be more relaxing than her day so far had been.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">___</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: Boggart&rsquo;s corpse acquired</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
