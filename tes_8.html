Several of her classmates had seen the encounter with the boggart-as-Madoka, including the boggart&rsquo;s accusations that she had murdered, tortured, loved, and forced herself upon Madoka. They had then seen her </span><span class="c1">murder</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;exterminate the boggart with muggle weaponry and zero hesitation. Then she almost fought Professor Lupin. Hufflepuffs were generally a tight nit bunch, so she didn&rsquo;t think they would&rsquo;ve revealed all of the details&hellip; But someone had to have talked by now, meaning most of Hogwarts probably already knew something had gone down at this point.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On second thought, her shield held several months worth of rations. She could just duck out and eat those elsewhere. Maybe for the next few days or weeks, too. Spinning around, Homura quickly walked away, taking a roundabout route towards the Astronomy tower. While a popular location for lovers, during dinner on a weeknight no one should be there.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Fortunately, no one from the Great Hall was quite willing to chase her as she made her </span><span class="c1">escape</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;tactical retreat. Unfortunately, she did not escape all the unwanted tag alongs. When she was almost to the tower, she heard the sound of footsteps behind her. She was not really in a position to escape, so she turned around. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Running towards her was the Potter girl. That wasn&rsquo;t exactly expected, she didn&rsquo;t recall interacting with her more than once. Specifically when&hellip; she saw Potter being surrounded, was struck by a sense of deja vu, and decided she may as well help her out. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter finally caught up. &ldquo;Ah, Akemi, I was hoping to talk to you? Preferably in private?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura starred. &ldquo;I have no intention of talking about my boggart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter looked up at her. &ldquo;Oh, you just had your boggart lesson today, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Potter trailed off as Homura&rsquo;s stare transformed into a glare. &ldquo;&hellip;interesting but not really what I wanted to talk about.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very well then, follow me.&rdquo; Homura turned to continue on her way to the astronomy tower. Potter hesitated, then hurried after her. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They were both silent as they went up the tower. Homura was pleased that her prediction was correct and the tower top was indeed empty. She sat down on the rim and pulled out a prepackaged meal. She opened it and started eating. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Um, are you having dinner here?&rdquo; Potter asked, glancing at her food. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Prepackaged food is inferior to that served at dinner, but I do not wish to visit the Great Hall at this point in time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter nodded. &ldquo;I get that, it can be a bit much sometimes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pleased at Potter&rsquo;s easy acceptance, Homura offered the girl a meal. After some hand waving and nonsense about not being a burden (Homura saying she had a couple hundred stored away was met with wide eyes) Potter accepted and they both started eating.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura was curious about what Potter wanted, but lost nothing letting the clearly nervous girl find her confidence. After they finished Potter finally managed to ask her question in a somewhat steady tone.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why&hellip; Why did you call me a girl? Back when we were talking last year?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura frowned. She only faintly remembered that incident. Was this some kind of trick question? Hesitatingly, she answered, &ldquo;Because&hellip; you are a girl?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter let out an eep, blushing slightly. &ldquo;What? But how I look&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura gave her a look. If this conversation was seriously about not feeling pretty enough, it was going to be a short one. &ldquo;Potter, you look fine. Sure you don&rsquo;t follow traditional conventions of femininity like wearing a skirt, but you look attractive enough anyways so I don&rsquo;t see why you would care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter&rsquo;s blush increased dramatically at this. &ldquo;Umm, but&hellip; what about all the Boy Who Lived stuff?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why Ron Weasly would matter in this case.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter stared at her, confusion overcoming her embarrassment. &ldquo;Sorry, what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said, I don&rsquo;t know why Weasly would-&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ron&rsquo;s not the Boy Who Lived. I am.&rdquo; Homura&rsquo;s confusion at this conversation rapidly increased. She could have sworn Weasley was the boy who lived&hellip; though she supposed Weasley and Potter were close together much of the time, so the comments she&rsquo;d heard would also fit if her classmates had been talking about Potter instead of Weasley. She hadn&rsquo;t thought they did, as Potter was supposed to be a girl, but&hellip; well it wasn&rsquo;t as if she paid much attention to gossip in general. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, why would a girl be called the Boy Who Lived&hellip;? Homura double checked with her magic. No, it seemed Potter still had the potential to be a magical girl. If anything her potential had increased over the summer, and was now approaching the power levels of Sakura or Mami. Now what did that mean&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As Homura thought things over, she suddenly remembered half forgotten wiki dives she&rsquo;d had way back when she first figured out she liked </span><span class="c1">Madoka</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;girls. Not to mention the additional research she&rsquo;d done when learning she was back in the 1990s, and in a different country no less. Right, there was a convention for what to do when one was confused about something like this.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I apologize Potter,&rdquo; she said, facing them directly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start this conversation over again. Do you have any pronouns you would prefer me to use? Such as she/her, he/him, they/them, or something else?&rdquo; Potter stared at her for several moments.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura started to shift uncomfortably. Was that not right? Did she screw something up? &ldquo;You&hellip; don&rsquo;t have to answer that question if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; She finally mumbled as the conversation remained frozen. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make you feel uncomfortable-&ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo; Potter seemed to find their nerve. Then, in a voice so quiet Homura could barely hear it, they said, &ldquo;I, um&hellip; think that&hellip; I might&hellip; maybe&hellip; prefer she/her.&rdquo; Homura let out a mental sigh of relief. Thank heavens she hadn&rsquo;t been misgendering the girl the whole time. &ldquo;But, um&hellip; no one&rsquo;s called me that before&hellip; and I&rsquo;m a boy&hellip; so I&rsquo;m not sure I can&hellip;&rdquo; Potter turned pleading eyes on her, silently asking for help.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can use whatever pronouns you want,&rdquo; Homura immediately assured her.. &ldquo;I assure you I will use them, and if you want me to only use them in certain situations I can do that too.&rdquo; Well, at least Homura now mostly knew what was going on. There was a likely trans girl sitting in front of her who was in need of help. Now all she had to do was help educate her while making sure not to make her feel she was unnatural or pushing her back into the closet. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On second thought, never mind. She was so screwed and unprepared for this. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter continued to speak while Homura had her internal dilemma. &ldquo;Ah, well then&hellip; she/her works while we&rsquo;re alone.&rdquo; At least she seemed slightly more confident now. &ldquo;Do, um, do you know why I feel this way?&rdquo; she continued tentatively.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re transgender,&rdquo; Homura blurted out, then instantly regretted. She was pretty sure you weren&rsquo;t supposed to say you thought someone was trans&hellip; though if Potter was already on that track did that actually count&hellip;? Thankfully, Potter seemed more interested at the thought of anything on her condition than Homura&rsquo;s poor question, and asked what that meant.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura decided the explanation she had been given was good enough. &ldquo;Well&hellip; when you are born you don&rsquo;t come out of the womb with a label with your gender, right? You&rsquo;re a baby, you don&rsquo;t even know what gender is.&rdquo; Potter nodded, hanging on her every word. &ldquo;Instead the doctors usually guess which gender you are based on your biological characteristics. Sometimes they are wrong though. That&rsquo;s when being transgender comes in, you are trans if your gender differs from the gender assigned to you at birth.&rdquo; Thank goodness she was through.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Potter nodded slowly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m pretty sure I have all of the&hellip; guy parts, what then?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Oh, right. Questions... Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, while biological characteristics may be correlated with gender sometimes, it&rsquo;s completely fine for you to be a girl even with your &lsquo;guy parts.&rsquo;&rdquo; Potter nodded slowly.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura checked her shield for resources so she could forestall any more questions. &ldquo;If you have other questions, I have several brochures, 49, excuse me, 14 books in english, 17 movies or TV shows on the topic on hand. I also have a downloaded version of Wikipedia and several research databases which might have something&hellip; And I have&hellip; several outfits that might fit you&hellip; and I have a bunch of medicines, some of them might be useful for medically transitioning. I can also contact my mother in the mail to acquire access to some local LGBTQ groups and other resources.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Potter was just staring at her now. &ldquo;Why do you have all that stuff?&rdquo; Homura glared back. It made perfect sense to have everything she did. The books and whatnot were necessary because she had occasionally needed downtime (she would know, she&rsquo;d tested it extensively and no downtime tended to result in a completely empty grief seed reserve come Walpurgisnacht). Tangentially related material was preferred for its potential usefulness later on, and since everyone important in her life seemed to be gay or bi that included LGBTQ topics in general. &nbsp;Since </span><span class="c1">her loops always failed</span><span>&nbsp;she was busy there was no point ever returning anything she checked out or purchased. Her time stop didn&rsquo;t allow for wifi, so downloading several databases also made complete sense for when she needed to look something up </span><span class="c1">so Madoka didn&rsquo;t know she had no idea who &lsquo;AKB48&rsquo; was</span><span>. The clothing was Madoka&rsquo;s, as Holly seemed around 150cm tall right now and she had wound up storing several versions of Madoka&rsquo;s outfits for various reasons (like the one time they were out shopping for clothes, stored several in Homura&rsquo;s shield in an emergency, </span><span class="c1">and then Madoka died</span><span>). The medicines, meanwhile, were acquired after a particularly bad timeline when Madoka had a peanut allergy, was stung, and then died early in a witch&rsquo;s labyrinth before Homura could get her to an epi pen. She had then spent the next 4 weeks </span><span class="c1">looting the entire pharmaceutical supply chain of Japan</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;acquiring any epi pens and any other medicine Madoka could conceivably need in the future. In summary, everything had a completely logical purpose.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Reasons,&rdquo; she eventually replied. Potter seemed to pick up that she didn&rsquo;t want to continue talking about this. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uhm, what&rsquo;s transitioning?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura let up on her glare. &ldquo;When someone realizes they are transgender they often take several measures to live more comfortably as their gender. The big ones are usually socially, such as by changing their name, pronouns, way of dress, and so on, as well as medically. I&rsquo;m not too aware of any of the details, though I could look them up.&rdquo; Homura hesitated briefly. &ldquo;Speaking of names, is there anything you want me to call you&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&hellip;Holly please,&rdquo; Holly responded, seemingly needing a moment to absorb the information overload. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura paused. They had probably covered enough information for now. &ldquo;Holly, do you want me to give you the brochures and maybe a book or two, and then we can talk later? Maybe next week after you&rsquo;ve absorbed some of the info?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly nodded, &ldquo;Yeah, um sure that sounds good. But first, uh, something else happened and I&rsquo;m hoping you could give me some advice?&rdquo; At Homura&rsquo;s nod, she proceeded to explain how her boggart experience had gone. &ldquo;And so I&rsquo;m afraid that if I told anyone else about this then they would laugh at me too&hellip; And I don&rsquo;t really want that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I am aware that some people are not nearly as accepting of this topic as others&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t assume that they would necessarily not be accepting of you from this, particularly if you explained your circumstances. They weren&rsquo;t laughing at you or another classmate in your position. But it isn&rsquo;t a promising sign.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Homura then let out a sigh. &ldquo;Also, this isn&rsquo;t quite the same, but&hellip; I could tell you how my classmates feel about one of them being a lesbian?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly let out a startled, &ldquo;What! I hadn&rsquo;t heard anything&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That would be because during my interaction with my boggart today it&hellip; insinuated I had a crush on a girl. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly wrong&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly let out an awkward &ldquo;aaah&hellip; Good&hellip; Good luck with that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you. Admittedly I&rsquo;m not sure how much the gossip will spread&hellip; I might only be able to tell you about my Hufflepuff classmate&rsquo;s reactions. Either way, it seems Lupin&rsquo;s decision to have each student face their boggart in front of the class was a poor one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Heh, yeah, it really was not good&hellip;&rdquo; Holly agreed. &ldquo;He still seems more competent at the job than the last two ones we had, so maybe things will get better after we get through this unit? Though he told me I&rsquo;d still have to face my boggart in front of him at some point, and I really don&rsquo;t want to do that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that too much in the short term.&rdquo; Homura reassured her. &ldquo;The boggart that Lupin had recently died. He will likely need time to find another one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s good&hellip; I thought boggarts were supposed to be unkillable though?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Evidently not.&rdquo; Homura replied. &ldquo;Now if that is everything, Holly, I can give you some brochures and a couple books, and we can meet up here next week?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, yeah that sounds good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After handing over the brochures (in english thankfully), Homura left. Holly was told to leave a few minutes afterwards to alleviate any suspicion that they had been in contact. Now all Homura had to do was figure out how to get to sleep in her dorm without all her classmates nagging her&hellip; On second thought, maybe she could camp out in a classroom? She did have a few beds in her shield after all&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: First (intentional) coming out</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: Cracked egg!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: Gained trans resources </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Next chapters:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18e1SCJ4DATG6lIJVXmNAWX6LU5MamO-hJ6HTkfcctvM/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1687941341622936&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mfXolFWVZuVda1VwKCWmV">https://docs.google.com/document/d/18e1SCJ4DATG6lIJVXmNAWX6LU5MamO-hJ6HTkfcctvM/edit?usp=sharing</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
