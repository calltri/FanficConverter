Everyone was disappointed that the dementors were going to be staying long term, and Holly quickly decided to do her best to head Dumbledore&rsquo;s warning about sneaking out. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first week of class was also not particularly exciting. Each professor roughly went over what, exactly, they would be working on for the upcoming year. Some provided demonstrations of what they would do, or at least what they would be studying, such as Mcgonagall demonstrating her ability to turn into a cat and back. Snape, meanwhile, gave a dry lecture punctuated by insinuating the material was too complicated for their feeble little minds. So business as usual.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The exception to the usual flow of events was Professor Lupin&rsquo;s class, as no one had had him before. Holly and her friends were particularly excited to see him given how he&rsquo;d managed the dementors on the train. Not that he actually did that much magically, Akemi handled most of the action&hellip; But he at least seemed competent, and any amount of competence was welcomed after their last two years. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Entering the class, the Gryffindors were already interested. When Lupin told them they were doing a practical exercise on their first day, they became even more so. Holly in particular was ecstatic.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She grinned as she entered the room, and while Lupin explained about the boggart. He chose Neville to do the initial demonstration, asking him about his greatest fear and giving him some quiet advice. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Neville was adequately prepared, Lupin opened the wardrobe door and Snape stalked out, already starting to berate Neville on his potion making skills. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Riddikulus!&rdquo; Neville cried out. The boggart was momentarily engulfed in a poof of smoke. At the boggarts reveal, the entire class burst into laughter. Lupin even cracked a smile in amusement.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>All of the class, that is, except Holly, whose mood had turned from excitement to dread in the span of a couple of seconds. </span><span class="c7">Ah, well, at least I know what my greatest fear is now</span><span class="c2">, Holly thought somewhat hysterically as she looked forwards. Snape, now garbed in feminine garments like those she&rsquo;d seen Neville&rsquo;s grandmother, did not look very good. Holly had to admit that, between her existing hatred of Snape and how poorly the clothes fit him, she would have probably laughed too if it had happened the previous semester. But given her recently discovered feminine leanings, the entire thing felt like a slap to the face.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Would she look that terrible in feminine clothing? Would her classmates laugh at her like that if she did and they saw her? Such thoughts filled Holly&rsquo;s thoughts as she slapped a fake smile on her face to not seem suspicious and tried to stealthily move towards the back of the line. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Soon enough Neville was done and the rest of the class started moving through. None of their fears or counters were nearly as bad as Nevilles for Holly, but she felt terror rising in her gut anyways. Unlike all of them, when she reached the boggart her fear would become reality. </span><span class="c7">There&rsquo;s no way they won&rsquo;t figure it out as soon as they see it, </span><span>she thought. </span><span class="c7">Then when they do they&rsquo;ll start laughing at me and then the rest of the school will learn and they&rsquo;ll laugh too and maybe they&rsquo;ll kick me out of Hogwarts and then I&rsquo;ll go back to the Dursleys and then they&rsquo;ll learn and&hellip; I&rsquo;m so, so, so, so goddamn screwed.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Holly&rsquo;s panic reached a peak as she neared the front of the line. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Maybe I can just bolt out of the classroom? If I&rsquo;m fast enough Lupin won&rsquo;t be able to stop me, right? And I&rsquo;m the girl who lived, right? That means I have traumatic experiences in spades. I can just say that I, I, I didn&rsquo;t want to see my parent&rsquo;s death or something? Yeah, that sounds good, it&rsquo;s not as if my social standing could get worse than if they knew I wanted to be a girl. </span><span class="c2">As Holly reached the front of the line, she was luckily saved from having to sprint out of the classroom by Lupin declaring that class was over for the day. Holly paused, briefly counted her blessings, and then turned to bolt out of the classroom at an only slightly slower pace than she was planning. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait a moment, Harry,&rdquo; Lupin called out just before she could escape. She turned reluctantly, waiting anxiously by the door as her classmates left. Once they all left, Lupin closed the door and turned to her.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I apologize for not letting you try with the boggart, Harry,&rdquo; Lupin started out saying. Holly felt a sense of confusion creeping up on her. The last 10 minutes she had been desperately wanting to not face the boggart, why in the world would Lupin apologize? &ldquo;As a Gryffindor I&rsquo;m sure you wanted to face your fear head on, but you&rsquo;ve seen a lot and, well, I didn&rsquo;t want to scare any of your classmates.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly felt that it was perfectly fine that she didn&rsquo;t try the boggart. If her fear was anything else she might have indeed been annoyed at not participating with her classmates. But exposing a secret that could set even her closest classmates on her like a pack of Hyenas? No. Or at least, not unless it was necessary or she figured out a better way of sharing it. On the other hand, the way Lupin phrased it it didn&rsquo;t seem like he was aware of her feelings. Maybe he thought she had a different fear&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry professor,&rdquo; she eventually stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your parents, Harry. I was worried you&rsquo;d see your parents and You-Know-Who.&rdquo; Lupin gazed at Holly with a complicated look that seemed to carry some pity, but also some other emotions Holly couldn&rsquo;t interpret. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly was somewhat stunned that her made-up excuse somehow matched Lupin&rsquo;s thoughts on why she might have a problem with the boggart. Eventually she managed to come up with something to say. &ldquo;I&hellip; can see how that would be a problem professor.&rdquo; Thinking quickly, she added, &ldquo;I also don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m particularly ready to see that either&hellip; Is that all, professor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re not feeling up to it then I am certainly not going to push you to try today,&rdquo; Lupin said. Holly felt a sinking feeling in her gut at the mention of &lsquo;today.&rsquo; &ldquo;I should warn you, though, that you will need to come in and face the boggart at some point over the year.&rdquo; The sinking feeling intensified. &ldquo;We can do it in private, though I will need to be there to supervise. You will also need to attempt the spell. Don&rsquo;t worry too much if you don&rsquo;t get it, fears related to death can be incredibly difficult to handle, and that difficulty will be reflected in your grade even if you don&rsquo;t ultimately succeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly&rsquo;s sinking feeling was now almost as bad as it had been before, at the mention her apparent salvation was, in fact, only temporary. &ldquo;O-Of course, sir,&rdquo; she eventually got out. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seeming to pick up on her unease, Lupin evidently felt the need to continue. &ldquo;I understand that you might not want to do this, but you could see a boggart at any time. If you can&rsquo;t handle one, dark wizards may even seek to use them to incapacitate you. It&rsquo;s much better to work through your fears in a safe environment instead of when you&rsquo;re alone and without support.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I suppose, sir,&rdquo; Holly reluctantly affirmed, all the while thinking that the environment didn&rsquo;t feel all that safe at the moment. &ldquo;May I go now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course, Harry. I hope you have a more pleasant afternoon.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly finally, left thankful that the horrible experience was at least done for today.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly did not have a pleasant afternoon. Learning that her supposed friends might turn on her if they learned of her innermost feelings did not inspire anything good in her. The fact that eventually she would eventually have to show her fears to Lupin, the man who put her in this situation in the first place, only worsened her mood. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ron picked up on her unease, and tried to subtly inquire into it. Holly stonewalled him hard. No way was she sharing anything in this state. Hermione meanwhile seemed consumed by her 12 classes, and thus did not bother Holly. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thinking things over, Holly came to a few decisions. Most importantly, she was definitely not sharing anything until further notice. The potential for things to go wrong was way too high. Approaching Akemi was still on the table though. She didn&rsquo;t need to admit to her feelings to ask why Akemi thought she was a girl, after all. As for Lupin and the boggart&hellip; she really didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Hopefully things will resolve themselves somehow&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Egg status updated to &lsquo;terrified egg&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Additional note: Hope you managed to get through that. This is probably the worst chapter in terms of transphobia. Holly is still in a very unstable state emotionally, and is correspondingly very vulnerable to transphobia. Things will get better from here.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Also, I did think about retconning the boggart scene to make it less problematic, as most other writers of trans Harry stories I&rsquo;ve seen have done. I decided I wanted to tackle it head on, though, because it is a messed up scene and I wanted to show the consequences of that directly. Also because of nuance, and showing that while Lupin is a good guy generally, even good guys can promote or allow plenty of transphobic or harmful things through ignorance and not thinking their actions through.</span></p></body></html>
