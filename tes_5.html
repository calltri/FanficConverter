The night bus, while definitely an experience Holly did not want to experience again, did carry out its work and deliver her to Diagon Alley. At which point Fudge himself showed up and told her that she was not, in fact, expelled from Hogwarts and that Aunt Marge had been successfully recovered and dealt with. Holly felt an immense sense of relief at being able to go to Hogwarts. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next few weeks passed fairly uneventfully. While Holly might have been able to find something on feeling like a girl in the muggle areas of London, Fudge had been very firm on Holly not going out of Diagon with Black on the loose. Holly still wasn&rsquo;t quite sure why, exactly, she needed to be so worried about Black, but she didn&rsquo;t feel like testing him right after he stopped her from being expelled. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The opportunities to do anything anonymously in Diagon Alley were nonexistent, of course. As such Holly mostly whittled away her time eating ice cream and reading through various books. While none of them looked particularly helpful, she did find several practical self defense books that she proceeded to purchase. She did seem to wind up in a lot of situations where they might help, after all. The books recommended practicing several of the basic spells to the point of mastery, such as protego, expelliarmus, and stupefy, so Holly added an hour of practicing them to her daily schedule. Her friends also showed up, and Holly greatly enjoyed catching up with them. She still wasn&rsquo;t ready to share the biggest things to happen to her over the summer, but she felt she was getting there.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Soon enough school break was over, and Holly was headed off to Hogwarts. Akemi would undoubtedly be unavailable again, and based on how crowded all the compartments were it&rsquo;s not as if she could get Akemi alone anyways. The conversation would have to wait until after they arrived at Hogwarts. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Eventually she and her friends did manage to get an apartment with a sleeping &lsquo;Professor Remus Lupin,&rsquo; as well as a few tag alongs like Ginny and Luna. They proceeded to chat about various topics as the train ride went on. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Then, well before they should have arrived at Hogwarts, the train abruptly came to a halt.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Ginny asked for the group. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not at Hogwarts yet, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hermione agreed. &ldquo;I&hellip; guess we just wait until someone tells us what&rsquo;s happening?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The group silently followed that course of action. As the minutes went by, the air seemed to get colder, and Holly felt a rather nasty sensation build up. It was like all her disgust at being called a boy, fear of death, and generally negative experiences were building up. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Suddenly the door to their compartment opened. Standing in the entrance was a hooded figure, face hidden behind an impenetrable darkness. Holly&rsquo;s bad feeling instantly redoubled and seemed to be crawling up her throat. She urged herself to move, to throw spells at whatever this was, or something. But the fear was overwhelming and she instead shivered in place. The figure stepped closer.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A crack sounded out. The figure jerked to the right, something seeming to have hit it in the head. Several more cracks followed, blasting holes straight through its body. It collapsed on the ground, seeming to writhe in agony for a few moments before dissolving. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The compartment was stunned at the sudden turnaround, stuck staring at the doorway. Which meant they all saw as Akemi of all people appeared in the doorway. She was dressed in a black, grey, and purple outfit that was, well&hellip; considerably more flattering than their school uniforms. Holly felt herself flushing a bit at that. She also appeared to have the shield she sometimes carried around strapped to her left arm, and&hellip; no, Holly&rsquo;s eyes were not deceiving her. That did indeed look like a muggle pistol she was still leveling at the place the figure had disappeared. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After a few more moments Akemi seemed to decide that the figure was truly dead, and turned her attention to the group. &ldquo;Is everyone alright?&rdquo; She asked, her eyes flickering between them as if trying to root out if any of them were injured. &ldquo;I apologize for not stopping this one earlier, it took some time to get to this section of the train.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As Akemi cajoled everyone into nodding that yes, they were OK, Holly heard a noise from behind. Looking back it seemed as if Professor Lupin had woken up and was staring at Akemi with eyes open wide.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did&hellip; you just kill a dementor? With a muggle firearm?&rdquo; He asked in an astonished tone of voice.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point Hermione seemed to have recovered enough to put her encyclopedic knowledge to use. &ldquo;Wait, I read about Dementors in my textbook, aren&#39;t they supposed to be impossible to kill?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With the attention of the entire apartment now firmly on her, Akemi seemed to wilt slightly. &ldquo;I&hellip; just shot it with my gun. Most things seem to die from that&hellip;&rdquo; She finally shrugged out. It was at this point she seemed to notice Professor Lupin, and she straightened to address him. &ldquo;I was not aware there was a professor on board. Do you mind if I ask who you are?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Professor Lupin. I&rsquo;m teaching defense against the dark arts this year,&rdquo; he replied, and Holly watched as an extra bit of tension seemed to drain from Akemi at that.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Understood. In that case do you want the situation?&rdquo; Akemi questioned. At Lupin&rsquo;s answering nod she continued, &ldquo;About 5 minutes ago a couple hundred of these &lsquo;dementors&rsquo; appeared outside the train. Most of them stayed back, but a few approached and entered the apartment itself. In the interest of not provoking the greater body into attacking, I refrained from attacking them directly and have instead been patrolling back through the train and ensuring they didn&rsquo;t attack any of the students. This was the only one that did anything other than patrol the main passageway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lupin leaned back to contemplate the situation. After a few seconds of this Akemi went back to looking back and forth through the corridor suspiciously, as if another dementor might jump out at any moment. Eventually Lupin let out a sigh, suddenly looking every year of his age. &ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s what happened. Our student here&hellip; what&rsquo;s your name? And did anyone else see you kill the dementor?&rdquo; Following Akemi&rsquo;s repy, he continued. &ldquo;Right, Akemi here did not actually kill any dementors.&rdquo; The residents of the compartment all turned as one to stare at the professor, not sure why he was trying to deny reality. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The reason for this is that, while dementors are soul consuming monstrosities that the world would be better off without, they are also employed by the ministry and so count as ministry officials. Killing a ministry official tends to be punished by sending the killer to Azkaban. Now it&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone would actually be prosecuted in case such a thing occurred, but there&rsquo;s no precedent and no real reason to burden a young, promising Hogwarts student with the duty of creating one.&rdquo; At this everyone nodded, though Hermione&rsquo;s seemed particularly grudging given the flagrant rule violations going on. Akemi meanwhile had started staring off into the distance. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What happened instead is that Akemi used a far eastern version of our patronus charm to chase the dementors off. I&rsquo;ll be wanting her to come over to my office at Hogwarts to explain exactly what she did.&rdquo; Lupin&rsquo;s pointed stare was answered by a somewhat absentminded nod from Akemi. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to head down to the front of the train and get things sorted out there. I expect you all to remain in this compartment and eat some of this chocolate until I return. The chocolate should help with recovering from the dementor&rsquo;s effects. Also, Akemi put that firearm away. If I see you using it again I&rsquo;ll need to confiscate it&rdquo; With this Lupin moved to pass out several chocolate bars. After herding Akemi inside, he closed the apartment door. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The compartment remained quiet aside from the sound of packages tearing and chocolate being consumed. Akemi at some point put her firearm away (somewhere) and sat down next to Luna, still staring off into the distance. No one seemed to be in the mood for conversation after what had just happened.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A few minutes later, Ginny decided to break the silence, asking, &ldquo;So, Akemi&hellip; Where&rsquo;d you get that outfit from anyway? I didn&rsquo;t see you wearing it at the station?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Akemi, still seemingly out of it, responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a magical construct.&rdquo; And then she proceeded to snap her fingers. All of a sudden there was a flash of purple light, and then Akemi was dressed in Hogwarts robes once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was a moment of silence.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Blimey, was that wandless magic!?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That, that was at least two spells how did you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can we learn that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The sudden outburst of noise seemed enough to finally jolt Akemi back to full attention. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;That&hellip; was&hellip; a special technique from Japan?&rdquo; The questioning tone did not make Akemi sound particularly convincing. Seeming to realize this, she shook her head, after which point she regained part of her normal composure. &ldquo;Apologies. I was&hellip; attempting to understand how anyone could possibly think employing soul sucking monstrosities would be anything but a terrible idea. As well as why they thought sending them near children wouldn&rsquo;t result in someone dying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pausing to look around the compartment and seeing the commiserating looks, Akemi continued. &ldquo;My&hellip; special outfit is something that I acquired through a past experience in Japan. That experience is no longer available and came with&hellip; side effects that far outweighed any advantages that came with it. I&rsquo;m further not really sure how it works&hellip; just that it does.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With that Akemi managed to shut down most of the conversation. Hermione continued to ask several questions about how the process worked exactly, but Akemi&rsquo;s continued insistence that she didn&rsquo;t know eventually proved enough for her to stop asking. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Soon after, the train started moving again. Lupin returned to give them the all clear, and Akemi said her goodbyes and left to go back to her previous compartment. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, maybe that&rsquo;s why Akemi was against magical contracts,&rdquo; Ron commented. &ldquo;She gave something up for a fancy outfit ability but sold her soul for it or something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh good idea Ron,&rdquo; Holly said. &ldquo;I had totally forgotten about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry what,&rdquo; Ginny replied, having not been along for the previous conversation. The others rapidly filled her and Luna in.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well I suppose that makes sense,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;It still seems a bit silly to make a magical contract just so you don&rsquo;t have to change clothes though&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well we have more to go on than we did before,&rdquo; Hermione shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll learn more in the future?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Holly agreed.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the rest of the ride the group returned to various other idle chatter, albeit at a much lower level than before the dementors appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;&mdash;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: Dementor&rsquo;s corpse acquired (non-corporeal)</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
