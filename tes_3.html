He quickly determined that it probably wasn&rsquo;t a mistake. If Akemi had referred to him as a &lsquo;her&rsquo; or something, then he&rsquo;d have probably thought he&rsquo;d misheard. But she&rsquo;d said &ldquo;fellow girl,&rdquo; which was a bit too much evidence for him to think it wasn&rsquo;t intentional. &nbsp;He had no idea why though.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As he approached the Fat Lady, he decided that talking to his friends would probably not be of much help. Ron, while generally a good friend, would probably find the situation hilarious and not be particularly helpful. Hermione meanwhile was, well, Hermione and if Harry mentioned it to her she would probably start interrogating him about every last detail. Given that Harry himself had no idea what was going on, he didn&rsquo;t particularly want to deal with either of those yet. Besides, the issue felt&hellip; weirdly personal, and not something he was ready to talk about yet. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course, having exhausted the obvious candidates, he really didn&rsquo;t have anyone else to talk to now, did he? Most of his other friends were only casually associated with him, bringing it up with a professor felt weird, and the Dursleys were obviously a hard no right off the bat. Harry supposed he had no real choice but to ask the source of his confusion directly, and hope that somehow cleared things up. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Having decided on a plan of action, Harry decided to try and approach her during dinner, as the train ride would likely be too crowded to have a private conversation. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The plan was a complete failure. It seemed like the Hufflepuff 2nd years were doing their best to get as much socializing in with Akemi as they could before she left to go back to Japan or wherever she was from for the summer holidays. When Harry arrived at the great hall he found her surrounded by several of them already, and when she left several other Hufflepuff&rsquo;s jumped up to join her. The only way Harry could have approached would have been to ask her to talk to him in private in front of several witnesses, and he didn&rsquo;t feel any desire to set to rumor mill off again after the fiasco the Slytherin&rsquo;s Heir situation had caused. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Instead he resigned himself to the not entirely unpleasant task of chatting with his housemates on the last day of the year, hearing about their exciting summer plans and generally saying goodbye. Granted he himself didn&rsquo;t have anything planned given he had to head back to the Dursleys, but living vicariously through others was totally a viable solution to his lack of summer plans, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next day found Akemi still surrounded by Hufflepuffs, and so Harry resigned himself to talking with her next year. Instead, he took the opportunity to grab a compartment with Ron and Hermione and fill them in on meeting with Akemi. Without, of course, mentioning anything about her calling him a girl. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Blimey,&rdquo; Ron exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying you talked with the ice queen herself. How are you not dead.&rdquo; He proceeded to peer at Harry with squinted eyes, seemingly trying to figure out if Harry was still alive or simply a fairly corporeal looking ghost.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ron!&rdquo; Hermione interjected, giving him a light thwack on the head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Harry is perfectly fine. That said, what in the world caused her to approach you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Harry let out, a bit irritated that Hermione thought him that unapproachable. &ldquo;She mentioned something about having had experience being questioned by several people, maybe she was just feeling sympathetic or something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Hermione said, shaking her head while still in slight disbelief. &ldquo;It just seems very sudden. The only people I&rsquo;ve ever seen her talking to were professors and Hufflepuffs, and the latter only happened a few months after she transferred in. I don&rsquo;t suppose she said anything else of interest?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Actually she did mention something about how magically binding contracts are a bad idea,&rdquo; Harry said, carefully to ensure nothing else came out. &ldquo;And how it was apparently tradition to mention it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Does she make a habit of saving people from awkward conversations or something?&rdquo; Ron questioned while raising his hands in an exaggerated gesture of despair. He then continued more seriously, &ldquo;Though the advice isn&rsquo;t that bad. I know my great uncle on my father&rsquo;s side once made one with a dwarf exchanging his house for all of a dwarf&rsquo;s gold. Turned out the dwarf only had fools gold at the time, but the magical contract still made him give up his entire house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I completely agree with Ron on this, for once,&rdquo; Hermione expressed as she thought over what had been said. &ldquo;My parents are always going on about reading the legalese for anything you sign, so you aren&rsquo;t surprised after the fact.&rdquo; She then turned to give Harry a look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also possible she was warning you about something specific, and your luck is bad enough I could see someone trying to offer you a magical contract. You had better not sign anything without at least getting me to take a look at it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, yeah of course,&rdquo; Harry said in an attempt to appease Hermione. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t planning on anything and have no intention of signing anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Ron said, &ldquo;she must have some reason to not like contracts&hellip; what do you guys think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With this, the conversation proceeded to devolve into a series of ever more ridiculous possible contracts that Akemi, her parents, or her grandparents might have signed. The next thing Harry knew was that the train was moving into the station, at which point he had to say goodbye to his friends and head back to the Dursleys. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Dursleys proved to be just as pleasant to live with as ever. By which Harry of course meant it was somewhat tolerable only when both parties were ignoring each other&rsquo;s existence. And even when it was tolerable it was still very, very boring. Chores and summer homework filled some of the void, and Harry also read the occasional neglected book off of Dudley&rsquo;s bookshelf. But he wound up spending a significant amount of time with nothing left but his thoughts, and those thoughts turned inevitably towards the mystery Akemi had managed to provoke. Though without making any progress this mostly just resulted in a very frustrated Harry. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A breakthrough came halfway through July. In a desire to keep his mind distracted, Harry wound up moving through Dudley&rsquo;s book collection at record speeds. He moved so fast in fact, that he completely exhausted the fiction books that were available. Not quite desperate enough to resort to rereading books yet, he reluctantly pulled out some of the basic science books that Vernon had gotten for Dudley. These were relics from when Dudley&rsquo;s slightly above average science test score in 3rd grade convinced Vernon that Dudley was destined to become a great scientist, and had remained neglected since then.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed as he finished reading a paragraph on the importance of repeatability for scientific achievement. &ldquo;I can just repeat the experience a few times and see what happens! No need for Akemi to do that!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Boy, no yelling!&rdquo; came the cry of Vernon from downstairs. Harry immediately slapped a hand on his mouth in fear of provoking retaliation from Vernon. Fortunately he seemed to be too invested in whatever he was doing, so Harry carefully removed his hand from his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well definitely won&rsquo;t be asking for their help,&rdquo; Harry continued in a much quieter tone. Pondering it further, he realized he didn&rsquo;t really have anyone else he could ask to help him in his experiment. &ldquo;Well I suppose I can always just do it myself. &lsquo;Always nice to help out a fellow girl,&rsquo;&rdquo; He stated. Thinking on it it seemed similar to the experience he had with Akemi. There seemed to be a slight bubbly feeling in his gut that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed before too. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hm, that&rsquo;s not quite right. Maybe because I&rsquo;m not being called a girl? What about&hellip; I am a girl.&rdquo; Ah, that was definitely it, Harry thought. The previously small bubbling sense had increased several fold, and he felt almost as flustered as the time with Akemi. Not that Harry was in much of a state to appreciate this, being somewhat overwhelmed by the feeling of glee that was rapidly overtaking him.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Deciding to try and repeat the experiment like the book said he should, Harry chanted out &ldquo;I am a girl, I am a girl, I am a girl.&rdquo; Suffice to say, the feeling was still there. If anything it increased. He had to put his hands on his mouth to stifle a joyous shriek trying to erupt from him. At which point he noticed that his cheeks were very hot. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;OK, that is definitely a thing,&rdquo; Harry quickly stammered out. &ldquo;What about, I am Harry Potter, the girl who lived.&rdquo; Weirdly enough that didn&rsquo;t seem to work out as well. Maybe the issue was in the name? &ldquo;Alright what is a good female name&hellip; Maybe Holly? Let&rsquo;s try that, &lsquo;I am Holly Potter, the girl who lived.&rsquo;&rdquo; This time Harry was too late to stop the resulting shriek of joy. He managed to cut it off partway through, and immediately froze at the possibility of annoying Veron.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unfortunately it seemed like Vernon had heard as Harry heard him start to move and head up the stairs. Harry quickly dived for his pajamas and then bed. Vernon wasn&rsquo;t usually stupid enough to fall for his attempts at pretending to be asleep, but the knowledge that Harry was going to sleep and would not annoy him further tended to make the lectures about noise much more bearable. Unfortunately with Vernon already annoyed, further experiments would have to wait for later&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After the short lecture with Vernon, Harry&rsquo;s next few weeks were filled with continuing to experiment, albeit in a way less likely to antagonize the Dursleys. It seemed that calling himself feminine things such as cute, beautiful, and, of course, a girl generated a definitely happy feeling. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like anything else he had ever felt, but could compare with the joy of seeing Hogwarts for the first time or his parents in the mirror of Erised in intensity if nothing else. Using she/her pronouns also made him happy. Or Harry, supposed, made her happy. After all it&rsquo;s not like anyone else was in her head, may as well use whatever pronouns made her happier. And several feminine versions of her name made her happy as well, such as &lsquo;Holly,&rsquo; &lsquo;Heather,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hilda.&rsquo; Admittedly Harry was leaning towards liking Holly the best. Maybe she should use that name in her head too&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The newly christened Holly had also discovered a few less pleasant things, mostly from the Dursleys. Being called a boy or other masculine terms, he/him, and Harry did not feel particularly good. Worse, those terms had a nasty tendency to cancel out any of the happiness that Holly felt from being called a girl. If anything they felt worse now than before Holly ran her experiments. Not that they had ever felt particularly good in hindsight, but it was a lot easier to stomach them before she experienced more feminine terms. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite the success of her experiments, Holly was not entirely sure where she should go from here. She had thought about wearing girls clothes, but didn&rsquo;t have anyway of getting them without alerting the Dursley&rsquo;s. Borrowing any of Petunia&rsquo;s clothes was likewise out of the question, as she was very meticulous about how she organized her closet and would notice if Holly disturbed it. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The entire situation was further very weird and out of her depth. After all, wasn&rsquo;t a boy being called a girl supposed to feel bad? Dudley&rsquo;s gang certainly liked to use it as an insult towards some of the wimpier boys in class. In that case why in the world did being called a girl feel good for her? </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Still, Holly decided to reserve judgement for now. While she didn&rsquo;t know anyone else in her position, she also didn&rsquo;t know anyone with magic either. And look how that turned out? Maybe there was also some kind of secret society of boys who liked being called girls out there too?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She supposed a good start would probably be to ask Akemi about it, since she&rsquo;s the one responsible for the entire mess. If not her, then maybe Hermione could find something through her research? </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the meantime Vernon had said Aunt Marge would be coming over. She had better focus on surviving that ordeal&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: egg status updated to confused egg</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: discovered superhuman ability to overturn over a decade of socialization and correctly refer to self consistently instantly</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Author&rsquo;s note: More Akemi will show up soon enough, for those who are here for her.
