I&rsquo;m&hellip; Homura Akemi. Would&hellip; would you like to make a wish and become a magical girl?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It should be known that Homura despised plan 47 with every atom of her body. Unfortunately for her, she was willing to do almost anything for Madoka&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.m0n9faw5gaih"><span class="c6">Prologue</span></h3><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura sighed to herself. After time and time again of her failing to save Madoka, she had finally turned to the unthinkable: taking guidance from random comments on the internet. It was a plan made in desperation after she&rsquo;d realized she&rsquo;d just repeated the last 27 loops virtually verbatim, all of which rapidly failed. Clearly, something different was needed. Thus, she&hellip; decided to turn to the internet, and pray they were better at brainstorming than her. Or more realistically, could come up with a bunch of alternatives that for various reasons would never work, as well as a handful of surprisingly successful ones. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So far the results had been&hellip; around as well as usual, actually. Which of course meant terrible, but at least they weren&rsquo;t especially terrible. Even some of the more&hellip; unique plans had achieved some surprising amount of success before their inevitable end in dismal failure. Tricking everyone into thinking she had percentage-based precognition powers, for instance, had been significantly more successful in convincing everyone she knew what she was talking about than saying it was because of time travel. For some reason. Which didn&rsquo;t stop everything from ending in disaster, but still. She&rsquo;d marked down the most promising of the plans for later exploration, but the fact that she was surprised meant it was even more critical that she explore even the remotest of possibilities. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which led to&hellip; plan 47. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the record, Homura hated plan 47. With a passion. That was why it was plan 47, after all, and not something she did much, much earlier. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But&hellip; she&rsquo;d resolved to look into every possible solution to save Madoka, no matter how counter it went to her principles. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;She was just trying to avoid the inevitable at this point. She supposed she should force herself to get moving, then. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Stopping time, Homura stepped out from behind the tree she had been hiding behind. She carefully took a position in front of her </span><strike>friends</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;unsuspecting victims, put on her best attempt at a friendly face, and dropped the time stop. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; She forced out in what even she could tell was a terrible approximation of a cheery voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; Akemi Homura. Would&hellip; would you like to make a wish and become a magical girl?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As she observed the gaping expressions of Madoka and Miki, she felt her jaw involuntarily clench as she resisted the urge to run away out of embarrassment, tell them not to wish, or grab Madoka and run away to literally anywhere else. But no. Plan 47 said that she had to be as earnest as possible here. If the plan wasn&rsquo;t carried out to the best of her abilities </span><strike>no matter how pitiful those abilities were</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;then the results of the experiment would be tainted and she&rsquo;d&hellip; have to do it again&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&hellip;And if nothing else, Homura </span><span class="c5">hated</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;plan 47&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.79ksnbeykpsa"><span class="c6">Chapter 1</span></h3><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Madoka didn&rsquo;t know what to think at this point. She had just been heading with Sayaka to the mall to get some CDs, when all of a sudden the mysterious transfer student appeared in front of them. As in, appeared. Instantly. In a </span><strike>super pretty</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;cool-looking outfit. And then she explained that she was an actual magical girl, and offered to let them become magical girls too. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would have been enough for Madoka, but then she had invited them to her apartment to explain further. Which was&hellip; um&hellip; well it fit the magical girl aesthetic at least. Which was super cool. But also, it may have been just a bit intimidating? And also it was weird to not see the walls&hellip; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Anyways, the girl had given them some </span><strike>clearly store bought</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;nice tea and gone ahead and explained that they could both become magical girls, get a free wish on top, and all they had to do was fight witches. Whatever those were. And now she was opening the floor for questions, but Madoka couldn&rsquo;t even think of anything to ask!?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; huh. So I could, say, wish to heal Kyouko&rsquo;s hand and turn into a magical girl then?&rdquo; Sayaka asked. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Akemi replied, her face remaining in the same posture as it had throughout the entire meeting, lips slightly upturned in what could have looked like a smile if you eyed it sideways and with a lot of wishful thinking. Which Madoka of course had. The girl was probably just bad at expressing herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Still though&hellip; that seems like a lot to offer out of the blue,&rdquo; Sayaka said, at least half to herself. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you choose us?&rdquo; She asked. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because Madoka has a level of potential that surpasses any previous girl we&rsquo;ve ever seen. She would be an invaluable ally in witch fights and territory disputes.&rdquo; Madoka gasped. Really! She was that special!? &ldquo;...And it&rsquo;s only right to extend an offer to her best friend as well.&rdquo; Oh. Um&hellip; Madoka glanced over at Sayaka, who now seemed to be doing her best to keep a pained expression off her face, and only somewhat succeeding. That&hellip; could be a problem. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&hellip; of course! That makes sense,&rdquo; Sayaka replied in an exaggerated voice of agreement. &ldquo;How much potential do I have then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Akemi directed her gaze over Sayaka&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Somewhat middling, to be honest. Though, ah, I&rsquo;m sure with lots of practice you can become a competent magical girl.&rdquo; Madoka winced internally. That was going to run straight into Sayaka&rsquo;s inferiority complex&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d be a great magical girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; Homura&rsquo;s expression became even more strained. &ldquo;Right, of course you would. I&rsquo;m&hellip; sorry for implying otherwise.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;That&hellip; urghhh.&rdquo; Sayaka was now glaring daggers at Homura, before a light came up in her eyes. &ldquo;Fine then. In that case, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be </span><span class="c5">happy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to answer all our questions so we can be better prepared then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura paused a second longer than strictly appropriate, before responding with an &ldquo;of course.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sayaka grinned savagely. &ldquo;How about you start explaining those territory disputes, then?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&hellip; well, magical girls need to recharge their magic using grief seeds that drop from witches. However, there are a limited number of witches. Thus, magical girls often wind up fighting each other over spare resources.&rdquo; To demonstrate, Homura pulled out a black, spindly thing and held it up to what she had explained was her soul gem. A black wisp flew from the latter to the former. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry? You didn&rsquo;t feel the need to explain that before?&rdquo; Sayaka accused. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura just blinked owlishly, before responding, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sayaka slammed her hand on the table at that. &ldquo;The hell!? What do you mean I didn&rsquo;t ask!? You were the one supposed to explain what being a magical girl was like, why the hell would you leave out critical information!?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura didn&rsquo;t respond for several moments, her face completely flat. Madoka started squirming. &ldquo;Sayaka-chan&hellip; Please don&rsquo;t just accuse people of stuff? I&rsquo;m sure Homura-chan just has good intentions,&rdquo; she pleaded.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah right, Madoka. She&rsquo;s acting like some sketchy used car salesperson on this. Which means we need to ask all the uncomfortable questions to get anything out of her. Like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t suppose you are currently in a magical girl territory war at the moment?&rdquo; She directed at Homura.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Apparently, enough time has passed for Homura to snap out of whatever state she&rsquo;d been in. She picked up her tea from where it had been sitting for so long and took a sip, before responding. &ldquo;No. I am currently allied with Tomoe Mami, the only other magical girl in the city.&rdquo; Madoka turned to glare at Sayaka. See, it was all a big misunderstanding! &ldquo;And the half dozen other girls, most notably Sakura Kyoko, that I expect have aims on the city seem to be content to wait until she dies to move in. Aside from that, we can get the occasional roaming serial killer, but they tend to suffer a high attrition rate so the chances of them appearing in Mitakihara are relatively low.&rdquo; &hellip;Madoka turned from her glaring to stare at Homura. </span><span class="c2">What?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sayaka shouted in glee before pointing an accusing finger at Homura. &ldquo;Hah! I knew something was up with you. What&rsquo;s next, your &lsquo;soul gem&rsquo; is actually your soul or something!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura outright dropped her teacup at this. It bounced off her leg, before shattering on the ground, soaking Homura&rsquo;s foot. Homura herself barely seemed to notice, face rapidly paling and eyes drilling into Sayaka like she was trying to divine the secrets of the universe. Sayaka slowly wilted at that, pulling herself back into her seat at an agonizingly slow pace. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After what felt like an eternity, Madoka finally ventured to ask. &ldquo;Um, Homura-chan? Are you, um, alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura blinked, then glanced over herself. Seemingly aware again, she took several deep breaths&hellip; though she still didn&rsquo;t seem aware of the tea covering her floor. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I am perfectly fine, Kaname-san.&rdquo; That&hellip; Madoka and Sayaka shared a glance as they mutually agreed that she was not perfectly fine. &ldquo;In response to your question&hellip;&rdquo; Homura paused here again before continuing. &ldquo;Having your soul exist outside your body provides a number of tactical advantages.&rdquo; &hellip;</span><span class="c5">Oh my god</span><span>. &ldquo;The first of these is that when your body suffers lethal injuries, such as being impaled, decapitated, burned alive, total brain damage, and many, many more, you will still survive so long as your soul gem is intact.&rdquo; &hellip;</span><span class="c5">when? Not if?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;This combination also allows you to suppress your sense of pain during those events so they are less&hellip; excruciatingly painful. You can even maintain consciousness after losing a limb. Or most of your limbs&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo; Sayaka whispered while Madoka felt on the verge of going over to hug the girl. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are&hellip; are you sure that that&rsquo;s your soul?&rdquo; Madoka asked hesitantly, pointing towards Homura&rsquo;s gem. She really hoped this was all a misunderstanding. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Homura took a moment to think over that. &ldquo;...Technically no. After I contracted Kyubey informed me it was my soul&rdquo; </span><span class="c5">After?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;But I lack the means to independently verify their statements. It is possible that some other mechanism exists to explain why magical girls die when their soul gems are destroyed or taken 100m away from their body. In which case&hellip;&rdquo; Madoka could spot Homura&rsquo;s fist tightening well beyond what was probably comfortable. &ldquo;Your soul gem is probably not your actual soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You die if your gem is destroyed!?&rdquo; Sayaka asked, horrified and rightfully ignoring whatever nonsense Homura had spouted at the end there.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that something that this &lsquo;Kyubey&rsquo; told you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not until I saw it hap-&rdquo; Homura cut herself off, before continuing. &ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;Madoka decided she was no longer &lsquo;on the verge&rsquo; of trying to huge Homura. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She abruptly stood and marched over to Homura. Opening her arms wide, she put on a bright smile and asked, &ldquo;Is it alright if I hug you, Homura-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Homura looked at her, somewhat confused at first. Madoka watched in silence as her eyes wandered the room, seemingly unsure that this was actually happening. Eventually, they settled on Madoka&rsquo;s face, and she observed as they widened in&hellip; horror? </span><span class="c5">Oh, please let me have misread that,</span><span>&nbsp;Madoka thought. But no. It only got worse. Homura tensed even more than before, and then started&hellip; </span><span class="c5">Is she trembling?</span><span>&nbsp;Madoka deliberately locked her expression in place to not concern the girl even as she felt a chill go down her spine. </span><span class="c5">What could have possibly triggered this&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When tears started forming in the girl&rsquo;s eyes, Madoka very, very tentatively said, &ldquo;Homura-chan?&rdquo; The girl visibly flinched her shoulders back, before turning to fixedly look away. &ldquo;I, um, don&rsquo;t have to hug you if you don&rsquo;t want one&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura rigidly fixed her expression in place, seemingly forcing the tremors to stop. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s&hellip; fine.&rdquo; That didn&rsquo;t seem fine, but&hellip; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madoka very, very slowly sat on the couch before reaching her arms around the girl. She still refused to meet Madoka&rsquo;s eye contact, and the occasional tremor got through, but she kept still. When Madoka&rsquo;s arms fully enveloped her, she very tentatively tightened them, prepared to let go at a moment&rsquo;s notice at a bad reaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The girl kept herself still for a bit, before slowly starting to relax into Madoka&rsquo;s arms. Madoka could still feel her occasional shiver, and she didn&rsquo;t return the gesture in any way, but after a few minutes she was about as relaxed as Madoka thought she would get. Which&hellip; didn&rsquo;t make any sense? If she was afraid of the hug, then why would she relax from it? Unless&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Homura-chan,&rdquo; Madoka asked gently, still scared of spooking her. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;?&rdquo; Homura responded lethargically. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you tell us why you&rsquo;re offering to make us magical girls?&rdquo; Homura abruptly tensed at that, so Madoka hurriedly asked something else, &ldquo;Or who you talked to about this beforehand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thankfully Homura partially relaxed at that. &ldquo;I was, um, talking with Mami and Kyubey. Kyubey told us that&hellip; a really big witch was coming so we needed to recruit more girls. I&hellip; </span><span class="c5">volunteered</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo; From the way Homura twisted that word, Madoka sincerely doubted that. Nevertheless, she kept quiet after that, continuing her hug as the girl slowly relaxed again. Clearly, she needed it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An indeterminable amount of time later, Sayaka coughed, ruining the moment. &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt, but, ah, it&rsquo;s 18:00? And we kind of need to get home soon&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To Madoka&rsquo;s dismay, Homura practically leaped from her grip at those words. Unable to justify leaping after her, Madoka settled for pouting in Sayaka&rsquo;s direction. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll see you out the door.&rdquo; Homura succinctly stated. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, Madoka supposed she had no choice but to leave. She did make sure to repeatedly promise Homura that they&rsquo;d meet again tomorrow though. The girl was definitely in need of company. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the two of them walked home, Sayaka let out a groan. &ldquo;Fuck, that was&hellip; that was something.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Language&hellip;&rdquo; Madoka half-heartedly retorted. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sayaka just scoffed at her. &ldquo;But seriously, leaving aside all the magical girl stuff for now, what in the world was up with Homura? One second she&rsquo;s giving us this nice and easy pitch, the next second she&rsquo;s stumbling over answers and revealing a bunch of stuff? I would be infuriated if it didn&rsquo;t get so&hellip; sad. Plus whatever the hell that thing was at the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I know,&rdquo; Madoka agreed. &ldquo;...I think she&rsquo;s in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You think? With her soul being a freaking rock?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&hellip; I mean that&rsquo;s bad, but I think she&rsquo;s being&hellip; forced to do this or something.&rdquo; That&hellip; yeah, that made sense.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sayaka stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Forced?&rdquo; She asked in a low tone.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Did you notice how, after her initial explanation, she seemed like she was trying to convince us, but was doing it by sharing a bunch of horrible things?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And thinking back on it, wasn&rsquo;t her initial speech a bit stale? Like she&rsquo;d rehearsed it or something?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...I can see why you would think that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Plus she was clearly hesitant to touch me, but also really, really liked that hug?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I could definitely tell that, though it was a bit awkward that you kept doing it for almost anhalf hour, while I just sat there.&rdquo; Madoka felt heat rise to her cheeks, before forcing her attention back to the matter at hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hesitating a bit, she finally said the last bit that would complete her thoughts. &ldquo;If magic can do anything&hellip; do you think something like mind control or compulsions could?&rdquo; Sayaka took a bit longer to respond this time, but Madoka was patient.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fuuuuuuck&hellip; You think she&rsquo;s been mind controlled?&rdquo; She finally exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, um, maybe.&rdquo; Madoka couldn&rsquo;t help fidgeting a bit. &ldquo;It would probably be the worst case, but her being forced to try and get us to contract would explain some things. Like, um, she was trying to follow the letter of a command while desperately feeding us information that would make us reject it. And, um&hellip; the touch thing kind of reminds me of some of the stuff Mama talked about, about bad relationships and how to avoid them.&rdquo; &hellip;Madoka was glad the mortifying lessons on sex ed she&rsquo;d received were coming in handy. Even if this was from the more friend/romantic side of things, which they could have gotten through without the utterly mortifying stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sayaka sighed. &ldquo;...Goddammit I can see it. Shit. And I wanted to hate her for being an obtrusive bitch, but if she&rsquo;s doing what she can, then&hellip;&rdquo; Sayaka looked up at Madoka abruptly. &ldquo;If she is, though, then we need to be extremely careful. We&rsquo;ll need to figure out if she is being controlled, who she&rsquo;s controlled by, and how to save her, all while keeping anyone from figuring out what we&rsquo;re doing. And since it&rsquo;s magic, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll be able to rely on the adults either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Madoka paused as the enormity of the situation they may be dealing with struck her. &ldquo;Yes. We&hellip; maybe we can meet at our house and make some plans?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sounds good. And your Mom&rsquo;s a bigshot lawyer, maybe we could ask her some hypotheticals or something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That sounds like a good idea. We&rsquo;ll just have to be careful not to tip her off&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the two of them left, Homura took a second to just stand in front of her door. She then turned, marched straight to her bedroom, jumped on her bed, and screamed into her pillow. Repeatedly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometime later, she rolled over on her back and contemplated the failure of her life. The plan had&hellip; gone surprisingly well at the start. She&rsquo;d managed to successfully explain about magical girls, reading off the script she had basically memorized from all the times Kyubey and Mami had given it. Then she had reached the questioning phase and Sayaka had instantly been suspicious of her. It was frankly amazing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Basically the same exact pitch from Mami or Kyubey had her falling over her knees to become a magical girl but from her? Practically instant suspicion. Just like always. If that wasn&rsquo;t surprising enough, the girl had even managed to guess that soul gems were souls!? Like, how!?!? And she seemed to believe it too. It was&hellip; </span><strike>just a little hurtful</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;annoying that the only way for Sayaka to believe her was if she picked up the information as something Homura was hiding, but at least it got results. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course&hellip; just because the plan had achieved some major success, didn&rsquo;t mean that this timeline was going to go any smoother than before&hellip; Homura rolled to the side and hugged her pillow tightly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madoka. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It all came back to Madoka. Sure, Sayaka realizing the truths about magical girls was helpful in keeping her from contracting, but that was only a means to an end. If Madoka contracted&hellip; then it was all over. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And Madoka hugged her. Her. The one who was trying to trick Madoka into a contract. That&hellip; there was literally no way that Madoka should have reacted like that if she genuinely believed contracting was bad. The girl was kind and given enough time, sure, it was expected she&rsquo;d hug Homura at some point. Homura didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d deserve it, but she&rsquo;d been through enough loops to expect it to happen. </span><strike>Except for the really bad ones.</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;But never while Homura was talking about it. Madoka always, always, did something else first when the truth was revealed. Whether it was hovering in indecision while trying to balance Homura&rsquo;s warnings against the other girls&rsquo; incorrect opinions, repeatedly asking &lsquo;why&rsquo; as the kind girl tried to grasp how horrible the world could be, leaving to think things over, or having a breakdown. There was always something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe if she&rsquo;d tried some different explanations it could come to that, but she hadn&rsquo;t. She used basically the same ones she or the incubator usually did, depending on which of them wound up breaking the news to Madoka.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>All of which meant&hellip; if Madoka hugged her&hellip; then that meant she genuinely believed Homura when Homura said becoming a magical girl was a good idea. Which meant that&hellip; it was likely that </span><span class="c5">she</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">Homura Akemi</span><span>&hellip; would be responsible for Madoka turning into a magical girl in this timeline. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura screamed once more into her pillow. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She absolutely hated this. It was a complete perversion of her wish. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the long term goal, well, Homura was sure she&rsquo;d have witched out by now. As is - Homura briefly checked her gem. No reason to carelessly get herself killed before she could reset the timeline - it wasn&rsquo;t exactly great, but also wasn&rsquo;t the worst. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Probably a good sign that she should stop her </span><strike>useless mopping</strike><span class="c0">&nbsp;complaining and get a move on though.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emotions sufficiently exhausted for now, Homura methodically shoved them down, until she reached her standard operating levels. That would have to serve for the rest of the timeline. She needed to stay strong, and keep her eyes on the long term benefits that this doomed loop would grant her. The progress with Miki was literally revolutionary. Continuing this loop to see how it developed could lead to an approach that convinced Miki while keeping Madoka safe, somehow. Even if&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Homura shook her head to clear her thoughts. Regardless, she needed to continue moving forward. Hunting a witch seemed like a great idea, both for the momentary catharsis of blowing something up with high explosives and because she did need more grief seeds. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had a feeling she might need a lot of them this loop&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
