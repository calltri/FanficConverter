Most recently they had cornered him at the Gryffindor table in the great hall, surrounding him on all sides. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you really beat a Basilisk, Harry?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you use your evil snake powers to kill it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where is the chamber, Harry, won&rsquo;t you tell me best friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Harry was exhausted with the constant barrage, as despite telling the story several times people still wouldn&rsquo;t leave him alone. If they went on much longer Harry felt he might just snap and give them the same treatment he gave the Basilisk. At that moment a voice cut through the crowd.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Potter, Madam Pomfrey wants you back for a brief checkup to make sure nothing went wrong in the last 24 hours. I&rsquo;ve been instructed to escort you,&rdquo; the resident ice queen Akemi stated in a quiet but commanding voice, while smoothly cutting through the crowd. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Harry stared. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that Akemi would start talking to him out of the blue. Despite being sorted into Hufflepuff she was so reclusive Ravenclaws would have found her weird. Which wasn&rsquo;t to say she didn&rsquo;t talk with people. There were several Hufflepuffs that kept following her around trying to include her in their activities and she participated in class. But when she did she always seemed to be a step removed from the rest, and frequently wandered off into the castle to do Merlin knows what. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this point Harry realized that his staring had passed the point of socially acceptable, as well as that Akemi was offering an out to his current predicament. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, yeah I had better follow Akemi then. You all know how Pomfrey gets if you try to ignore her for too long,&rdquo; he eventually managed to stammer out. At that the &lsquo;well-wishers&rsquo; offered knowing but disappointed looks, and gradually wandered off.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As he approached Akemi she turned and headed off, clearly expecting him to follow. He did so, still somewhat confused about why Madam Pomfrey would want him back after releasing him only the previous day while saying he was fine. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After a few minutes of silent walking, he cautiously asked, &ldquo;So Akemi, um, what exactly is it that Pomfrey wants from me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She turned around to face him. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; After a few more seconds of Harry staring at her, she elaborated further: &ldquo;You seemed to be uncomfortable surrounded by all the sycophants. I felt that the least I could do was help you escape them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, well they weren&rsquo;t, um, that bad&hellip;&rdquo; Harry trailed off in a vain attempt to defend his classmates. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Akemi gave him a pointed look. &ldquo;Potter, I&rsquo;ve had my own share of random people trying to verbally engage with me without my consent. They were clearly annoying you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Harry had no real response to that and continued standing awkwardly. After a few moments, Akemi turned and started to move away. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, wait!&rdquo; He threw out, causing Akemi to turn her head towards him. &ldquo;I really appreciate you helping me out of there, thanks a lot.&rdquo; At this Akemi&rsquo;s face seemed to soften fractionally from its perpetual state of apathy. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really no trouble to help a fellow girl out.&rdquo; She paused momentarily, seeming to take a moment to think. &ldquo;And I suppose&hellip; for the sake of tradition I should warn you off making any magically binding contracts. They never work out well&rdquo; At that seemingly random statement it seemed Akemi was done, and she turned and walked away.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Harry continued standing in the corridor, somewhat confused by Akemi&rsquo;s last, cryptic statement, but otherwise happy to have had the conversation go so well. Eventually he shrugged it off and started moving back towards the Gryffindor common area. Well at least he had something to talk about with his friends on the train trip back, he thought. A successful conversation with Akemi as a non-Hufflepuff was surely almost in the same league as defeating a Basilisk, after all.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It was only at this point that he noticed a certain inconsistency in what Akemi had said earlier. </span><span class="c7">Wait, did she say &lsquo;fellow girl?&rsquo; What in the world???</span><span>&nbsp;As Harry mildly panicked over what it meant that someone he never interacted with was somehow under the impression that the &lsquo;Boy who lived&rsquo; was a girl, a second, much more subtle thought suddenly struck his mind. </span><span class="c9 c7">Wait, she called me a girl but I didn&rsquo;t even notice until the conversation was over&hellip; what in the world is up with that?!?</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What in Merlin&rsquo;s name is going on!&rdquo; he finally exclaimed, shocking some nearby passerbys as he aggressively stalked towards the tower.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: egg status acquired</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
