Aunt Marge&rsquo;s entire visit had been a complete disaster. It was all &ldquo;Boy you&rsquo;re worthless&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boy, your parents were terrible and you&rsquo;re living up to that standard.&rdquo; The fact that it took her an entire week to snap was surely a great testament to her self control. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Halfway to the park Holly noticed her eyes were starting to blur. &ldquo;God dammit! First I have to deal with Aunt Marge, then I can&rsquo;t suck it up for one more day so I&rsquo;ve been expelled from both the Dursleys and Hogwarts, and now I&rsquo;m crying like a girl!&rdquo; The familiar bit of weird glee formed at the last statement, even if it felt minuscule in comparison to everything else going on. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When Holly finally arrived at the park she stumbled onto a bench and sat there for awhile hoping the tears would subside. After a little while she resorted to calling herself a girl again. It didn&rsquo;t really fix any of her issues, but it felt really nice and Holly figured she was in need of something good after that entire debacle. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An indeterminate amount of time later, Holly finally composed herself. If she really had been kicked out of the Dursleys and Hogwarts, then she needed to figure something else out. At a very minimum she needed money. Her parents vault ought to have enough for her to live for awhile, so step one should be to get to Diagon Alley. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Having resolved herself, Holly looked up&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Right into the face of a black dog bigger than her, staring at her as if about to take a bite.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly immediately panicked, and dived for her wand. Restrictions on magic be damned, she was not going to die here. Unfortunately, Holly had placed her wand somewhat haphazardly on the far end of her trunk. To get to it Holly rested her arm on the not particularly well balanced trunk while leaning over with the other. The end result being the trunk slipping off the bench, and Holly following, rolling until she was right at the giant dog&rsquo;s feet. Holly decided the best move at this point was to stay still, though she wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was in some vain attempt at playing dead or a desire to not somehow repeat her embarrassing act. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The dog finally opened its mouth&hellip; only to start letting out a series of whoofs that sounded suspiciously like laughter. Holly stared incredulously at the dog for a few moments before deciding, yes, the dog was definitely laughing at her. Deciding that laughter probably meant the dog was not about to kill her, Holly relaxed fractionally and slowly stood up and moved to put her stuff in order. Making sure to keep her wand on hand this time. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh real funny, scaring me half to death when I&rsquo;m already feeling terrible, and then laughing at me,&rdquo; she berated the dog now that she felt a bit more secure. The dog, to its credit, stopped its laughing and tucked its ears back, whining a bit in apparent shame while staring at her with big, black eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Holly proved to not be immune to the charms of even an animal that had terrorized her not minutes ago. &ldquo;Alright, fine, I guess in hindsight it might be a bit funny,&rdquo; she reluctantly conceded. The dog seemed to take this as agreeable, giving out a bark and approaching her. Holly instinctively moved back, at least until the dog flopped down on its side while wagging its tail. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you really jump straight to asking for pets?&rdquo; She asked in a deadpan. The dog stared back at her, completely apologetic. &ldquo;Oh, fine, I suppose I can give you some pets for not eating me.&rdquo; Holly started to move towards the dog before abruptly stopping. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any flees on you, do you?&rdquo; She asked, not wanting to add yet another issue to her already large stack.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The dog appeared affronted and gave a quick shake of its head. &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s good enough,&rdquo; Holly said. &ldquo;Also, are you a male dog or a female dog? I wouldn&rsquo;t want to offend you by calling you the wrong thing.&rdquo; The dog appeared pleased with this, and following a short series of charades Holly determined that the dog was indeed male. Finally, Holly sat down next to the dog and began to pet him. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Following several minutes of silent petting, Holley let out a sigh. &ldquo;I think I wish I was a girl&hellip;&rdquo; The dog shifted, turning to look at her with a somewhat lost look. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Holly realized, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t actually know what I&rsquo;m talking about, do you.&rdquo; The dog shifted to put his head in her lap, seeming to give her his full attention. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well I may as well explain. It might help to talk about it with someone, and it&rsquo;s not as if I have anyone else to talk to.&rdquo; The dog seemed to shift awkwardly, but quickly settled down. &ldquo;It all started with this girl at school. She transferred in from Japan at the start of our second year. She also had some absolutely gorgeous hair. During her walk to be sorted she apparently did a hair flip and managed to get half our grade crushing on her.&rdquo; The dog&rsquo;s ears perked up at this.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Despite that it turned out she&rsquo;s a total ice queen. Most of the time she barely responded to anyone, and the one time Macmillan caught her full attention trying to ask her out she asked him to his face why he thought she would ever be interested in him.&rdquo; At this the dog outright snorted. &ldquo;A few of the Hufflepuffs did seem to become friends with her, but aside from that she basically didn&rsquo;t have a social life.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Despite this, on the last day of school she decided to spontaneously save me from some admittedly rather annoying gossipers. Then, when I thanked her she said &lsquo;anything for a fellow girl.&rsquo; In other words, she called me a girl! Completely out of the blue! I&rsquo;m literally called the boy who lived, how in the world do you even make that mistake!&rdquo; The dog curled his lips in apparent amusement.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And if that was all it would have been fine, but&hellip; well&hellip;&rdquo; Holly stumbled a bit here, feeling that ths was wrong to admit. The dog stared at her, whined, and nosed it&rsquo;s way deeper into her lap. Holly chuckled a bit at that, the distraction helping her build up her courage. &ldquo;I , uh, actually liked it&hellip;&rdquo; Holly managed to get out. This first statement seemed to be all that was needed to open the flood gates. &ldquo;But, I was really confused at first and didn&rsquo;t really know what to do. And I couldn&rsquo;t get a hold of Akemi before the train left, so I kind of just sat on it for a few weeks. But then I was reading this book on the muggle scientific method, and it mentioned trying out things several times to see if they consistently worked. So I tried calling myself a girl and it felt really, really good every time. And I know it&rsquo;s kind of weird, but, well, that&rsquo;s just what I feel&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The dog at this point was staring at Holly while remaining very still. &ldquo;Ah, well, part of realizing how much I like being called a girl seems to have made me realize how much I don&rsquo;t like being called a boy&hellip; And so when I meant I wished I was a girl I meant so that Aunt Marge would call me a girl so I wouldn&rsquo;t have been as hurt by her words and wouldn&rsquo;t have started something. Granted she still would&rsquo;ve insulted me continuously, and I might&rsquo;ve flipped anyways when she started insulting my parents to my face-&ldquo; The dog started grumbling at this point, and Holly smiled at him. &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s a bitch. But if I&rsquo;d kept my cool maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t be out here alone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, anyways thanks for listening. It&hellip; felt good to get that off my back.&rdquo; Holly stated. The dog wagged his tail and decided now was the perfect time to lick Holly on the cheek. &ldquo;Ah, ewww, dog slobber on my face&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Standing up, Holly dusted herself off. &ldquo;Well I should probably get going, I need to get to Diagon Alley somehow, and waiting around all night isn&rsquo;t going to get any closer. Not that I really know how I&rsquo;m going to get there without a ride&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this the dog jumped up. He gave a look as if to say he was sad Holly needed to go, but then proceeded to start nosing Holly&rsquo;s pocket where she had put her wand.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, what are you trying to do? I&rsquo;m not going to give you my wand,&rdquo; Holly said while pulling her wand out of her pocket and holding it away from the dog. The dog, seeing the wand, became even more energized and tried to grab it. &ldquo;Hey, no touching!&rdquo; Holly jerked her wand into the air to try and keep it away.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All of a sudden there was a great noise from the street. Holly turned to find an entire bus had suddenly appeared while she wasn&rsquo;t paying any attention. The bus door opened and someone shouted, &ldquo;Did you call for the night bus!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, what?&rdquo; Holly shouted back, by now very confused. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the night bus, we come to any witch or wizard who raises their wand in the air,&rdquo; came the reply.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, I think I can use that&hellip;&rdquo; Holly turned to grab her stuff&hellip; and discovered the dog had disappeared while she wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. &ldquo;Weird&hellip;&rdquo; She mumbled. &ldquo;I guess he got spooked or something? Though it was awfully convenient he got me to accidentally summon a bus right after I mentioned wanting transportation&hellip; Maybe he was a magical dog? Yeah that makes sense, he seemed pretty smart.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Putting that thought out of her mind, Holly continued to the night bus, and from there to diagon alley.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&mdash;&mdash;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Achievement unlocked: First (completely unintentional) coming out unlocked</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
